    "##### The objective of this project was to develop a simulation for vibration signals in spur-gear mechanics. This simulation modeling serves as a valuable tool for generating synthetic data, which can be instrumental in detecting anomalies within real vibration signals, enabling proactive predictive maintenance to prevent damage."
